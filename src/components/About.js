                Belethor's General Goods is a merchant's shop located in the Plains District of Whiterun. It can be found in the Whiterun Marketplace, next to Arcadia's Cauldron.

The shop is open every day between 8 am and 8 pm. It's owned and run by Belethor and his assistant, Sigurd. Like most general goods stores, Belethor will trade in almost anything, including weapons, armor, jewelry, potions, food and books. He typically has 750 Gold available every 48 hours. The Dragonborn can invest 500 Gold in his shop if they have the investor perk. After investing in his shop, most of the items in the shop can be taken rather than stolen.
